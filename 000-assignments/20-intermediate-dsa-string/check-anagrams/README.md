## Problem Description
You are given two lowercase strings A and B each of length N. Return 1 if they are anagrams to each other and 0 if not.

## Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105

A and B are lowercase strings

## Input Format
Both arguments A and B are a string.

## Output Format
Return 1 if they are anagrams and 0 if not

## Example Input
