# Q2. Compare Linked List
## Problem Description
Given heads of two linked lists A and B, check if they are identical i.e. each of their corresponding nodes should contain the same data. The two given linked lists may or may not be of the same length.

## Problem Constraints
1 <= size of linked lists <= 105

1 <= value of each node <= 109

## Input Format
You are given the head of two linked lists A and B.

## Output Format
Return 1 if both the linked lists are identical and 0 otherwise

## Example Input
Input 1:

A = 1 -> 2 -> 3

B = 1 -> 2 -> 3

Input 2:

A = 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1

B = 4 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1

## Example Output
Output 1:
1

Output 2:
0

## Example Explanation
For Input 1:
Both the linked lists are identical

For Input 2:
The value in the second node of both the linked lists
are different.
