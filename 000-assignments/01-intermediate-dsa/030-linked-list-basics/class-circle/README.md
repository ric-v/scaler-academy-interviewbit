# Q3. Class Circle
## Problem Description

Construct a class Circle that represents a Circle.

The class should support the following functionalities:-

    perimeter() -> returns the perimeter of the circle
    area() -> returns the area of the circle

Note: Assume Π (pi) = 3.14 for calculations.

## Input Format:

First argument A is an integer representing the number of testcases.
For each case, the radius r is taken as input in new line.

## Output Format:

The perimeter and area of the constructed circle is printed.

## Sample Input:

    2     # number of cases
    1     # radius of first case
    2     # radius of second case

## Sample output:

    6.28     #perimeter of first case
    3.14     #area of first case
    12.56    #perimeter of second case
    12.56    #area of second case
