# Q1. Find Perfect Numbers

## Problem Description
You are given an integer A. You have to tell whether it is a perfect number or not.

Perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.

A proper divisor of a natural number is the divisor that is strictly less than the number.



### Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 106



### Input Format
First and only argument contains a single positive integer A.



### Output Format
Return 1 if A is a perfect number and 0 otherwise.



## Example Input
Input 1:
A = 4

Input 2:
A = 6


## Example Output
Output 1:
0 

Output 2:
1 


## Example Explanation
### Explanation 1:
For A = 4, the sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 = 3, is not equal to 4.

### Explanation 2:
For A = 6, the sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, is equal to 6.
