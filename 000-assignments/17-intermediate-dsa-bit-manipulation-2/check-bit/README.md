# Q1. Check bit
## Problem Description
You are given two integers A and B.

Return 1 if B-th bit in A is set

Return 0 if B-th bit in A is unset


## Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 109

0 <= B <= 30


## Input Format
First argument A is an integer.

Second argument B is an integer.


## Output Format
Return an integer.


## Example Input
Input 1:
A = 4
B = 1

Input 2:
A = 5
B = 2


## Example Output
Output 1:
0

Output 2:
1


## Example Explanation
For Input 1:
Given N = 4 which is 100 in binary. The 1-st bit is unset
so we return 0

For Input 2: 
Given N = 5 which is 101 in binary. The 2-nd bit is set
so we return 1
